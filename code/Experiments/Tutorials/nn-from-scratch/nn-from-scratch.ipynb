    "# Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we will implement a simple 3-layer neural network from scratch. We won't derive all the math that's required, but I will try to give an intuitive explanation of what we are doing and will point to resources to read up on the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I'm assuming that you are familiar with basic Calculus and Machine Learning concepts, e.g. you know what classification and regularization is. Ideally you also know a bit about how optimization techniques like gradient descent work. But even if you're not familiar with any of the above this post could still turn out to be interesting ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "But why implement a Neural Network from scratch at all? Even if you plan on using Neural Network libraries like [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org) in the future, implementing a network from scratch at least once is an extremely valuable exercise. It helps you gain an understanding of how neural networks work, and that is essential to designing effective models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that the code examples here aren't terribly efficient. They are meant to be easy to understand. In an upcoming post I will explore how to write an efficient Neural Network implementation using [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). "

We will use `tanh`, which performs quite well in many scenarios. A nice property of these functions is that their derivate can be computed using the original function value. For example, the derivative of $\\tanh x$ is $1-\\tanh^2 x$. This is useful because it allows us to compute $\\tanh x$ once and re-use its value later on to get the derivative."

You can think of them as matrices transforming data between layers of the network. Looking at the matrix multiplications above we can figure out the dimensionality of these matrices. If we use 500 nodes for our hidden layer then $W_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2\\times500}$, $b_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{500}$, $W_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{500\\times2}$, $b_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Now you see why we have more parameters if we increase the size of the hidden layer."

We call the function that measures our error the *loss function*. A common choice with the softmax output is the [cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression). If we have $N$ training examples and $C$ classes then the loss for our prediction $\\hat{y}$ with respect to the true labels $y$ is given by:\n",

    "Remember that our goal is to find the parameters that minimize our loss function. We can use [gradient descent](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/) to find its minimum. I will implement the most vanilla version of gradient descent, also called batch gradient descent with a fixed learning rate. Variations such as SGD (stochastic gradient descent) or minibatch gradient descent typically perform better in practice. So if you are serious you'll want to use one of these, and ideally you would also [decay the learning rate over time](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#anneal).\n",

To calculate these gradients we use the famous *backpropagation algorithm*, which is a way to efficiently calculate the gradients starting from the output. I won't go into detail how backpropagation works, but there are many excellent explanations ([here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) or [here](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/)) floating around the web.\n",
